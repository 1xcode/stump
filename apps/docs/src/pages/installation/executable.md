On [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump/releases), Stump has pre-built binaries, for both the Stump server and desktop application, for Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

## Downloading the Stump desktop application

If you want to install the desktop application, you will want to select the appropriate binary for your operating system:

- macOS: `Stump.dmg`
- Linux: `Stump.AppImage`
- Windows: `Stump.exe`

## Downloading the Stump server

Otherwise, for the Stump server, follow the instructions below for your operating system to install Stump.

## Linux

## Windows

{% callout title="Note" icon="note" %}
I am currently exploring solutions for Windows systems to be able to configure Stump as an auto-startup service. For now, you will need to manually run the executable from the command line.
